Exploratory Data Analysis: World Population Dataset
Project Description
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of world population statistics. The analysis aims to uncover insights about global population distribution, trends, and relationships between different features such as population, area, and density. The project involves data cleaning, correlation analysis, and various visualizations to highlight key patterns.

Key Features
* Data Cleaning:
   * Filled missing values with the mean for numerical columns.
   * Converted population-related columns to integer data types.
   * Renamed columns for clarity (e.g., Country/Territory to Country).
   * Removed unnecessary columns like CCA3 and duplicate rows.
* Exploratory Analysis:
   * Calculated correlation between numerical features and visualized using a heatmap.
   * Ordered data by population for better insights.
   * Grouped data by continents for comparative analysis.
* Visualizations:
   * Heatmap to show correlations between features.
   * Bar chart of the top 10 countries by population.
   * Pie chart showing world population percentage by continent.
   * Scatter plot of population vs. area by continent with density as size.

Methodology/Approach
1. Data Cleaning:
   * Filled missing values and standardized column data types.
   * Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns.
   * Sorted data by population for analysis.
2. Correlation Analysis:
   * Created a correlation matrix for numerical features.
   * Visualized correlations using a heatmap.
3. Visualizations:
   * Bar chart for the top 10 most populous countries.
   * Pie chart to illustrate population percentage by continent.
   * Scatter plot of population vs. area with density as size.
